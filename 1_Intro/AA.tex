\subsection{Autonomous Airliners (AA)}

Autonomous airliners represent a branch of \glspl{UAV}, consisting of fixed-wing aircraft capable of flying and navigating without direct intervention of a human pilot, for passenger service.
Although modern commercial airliners already automate approximately 93\% of flight functions, there remains a growing demand to implement higher levels of autonomy  \cite{Vance_2019}.
Increased automation is seen as a path toward enhanced safety, greater scalability, and improved affordability.
