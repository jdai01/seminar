\subsection{Objective}

The aim of this paper is to explore the potential of \gls{AI} in transforming \gls{ATM} by enabling the safe and efficient coordination of autonomous airliners and \gls{UAM} within busy airspaces.
It examines the limitations of current \gls{ATM} and \gls{UTM} systems, highlight key \gls{AI} applications such as dynamic sectorisation and digital \gls{ATCO} assistants, and analyse the  challenges involved. 
This paper also offers an outlook on the future of \gls{AI} driven \gls{ATM} and the path towards fully integrated, autonomous \gls{ASM}.
