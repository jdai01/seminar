\subsection{Urban Air Mobility (UAM)}

According to \gls{EASA}, \gls{UAM} refers to an air transportation system for passengers and cargo in urban environments.%, with the transportation performed by an electric aircraft capable of \gls{VTOL}, either remotely piloted or with a pilot on board \cite{easa_uam}. 
It primarily consists of \gls{eVTOL} aircrafts, with air taxis used for passengers and drones for delivery of cargos, surveillance, and photography. 
These aircrafts can either be remotely piloted or with a pilot on board \cite{easa_uam}. 
If these aircrafts are capable of autonomous flying, it is considered a part of \gls{UAV}.
