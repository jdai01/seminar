\subsection{UAS Traffic Management (UTM)}

\Gls{UTM} is a system for safely managing \gls{UAV} operations at low altitude. 
Separate from but complementary to \gls{ATS}, it enables fucntions such as flight planning, authorisation, surveillance, and conflicht management to mitigate risks and ensure safe, efficient operations of \glspl{UAV}.
There is ongoing work to fully realize the benefits of \gls{UTM} \cite{faa_utm}.
