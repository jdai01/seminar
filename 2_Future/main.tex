\section{Future of AI in ATM}

\Gls{AI} presents transformative opportunities to enhance the capabilities of ATM by enabling faster decision-making, real-time data processing, and adaptive system responses. 
From optimising flight trajectories to dynamically managing airspace sectors and supporting \glspl{ATCO}, \gls{AI} is poised to play a central role in reshaping how air traffic is coordinated in the future. 

The following subsections explore key areas where \gls{AI} is driving innovation in \gls{ATM}.
This is not an exhaustive list, as many other emerging research trends and experimental applications are actively being explored.
