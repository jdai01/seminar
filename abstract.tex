The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into Air Traffic Management (ATM) is reshaping the aviation sector, offering new possibilities for operational efficiency, safety, and capacity management. 
Recent advancements, such as AI-assisted flight planning, dynamic airspace sectorisation, and digital assistants for air traffic controllers, signal a shift toward more adaptive and intelligent systems. 
However, the deployment of AI in ATM remains challenged by regulatory fragmentation, technical limitations, and human factors including trust, role transformation, and skill retention. 
This paper examines the current developments and multifaceted challenges associated with AI integration across political, organizational, technical, operational, and human domains. 
It also explores the long-term vision of fully autonomous, unmanned ATM systems, recognizing the significant research, policy, and ethical considerations that must be addressed. 
A collaborative and measured approach involving all stakeholders is essential to ensure AI enhances rather than replaces human oversight, ultimately supporting a safe and efficient evolution of global airspace management.
