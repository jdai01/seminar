The rapid evolution of air transportation, driven by the emergence of Urban Air Mobility and autonomous airliners, necessitates significant advancements in current Air Traffic Management (ATM) systems. 
This report investigates the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies into existing ATM infrastructure to address persistent challenges such as inefficient flight planning, constrained airspace capacity, and the escalating cognitive workload on air traffic controllers. 
Through analysis of AI-driven case studies, including the Metropolis projects and strategic airspace management models, the report demonstrates how AI can enhance dynamic airspace allocation, optimize traffic flow, and improve overall safety and efficiency. 
Furthermore, the report examines key challenges in AI integration, including maintaining interoperability with legacy systems, ensuring scalability to handle increasing traffic volumes, complying with regulatory frameworks, and guaranteeing system robustness and safety. 
These considerations are critical to realizing a resilient, adaptable, and future-ready ATM system capable of supporting the demands of next-generation aviation.
