An appendix to the scientific work is necessary if materials that relate to the work as a whole or larger parts of it are difficult to accommodate in the executive section. This is particularly the case if, due to their size, they would disturb the overall context of the execution. In terms of content, the appendix must not contain anything that is necessary for understanding the text, the text of the work must not be continued at this point "under different circumstances". It should not be used to give the work a larger scope and make it appear "thick"!
The appendix is suitable for additional documents and materials, especially if these are difficult or impossible for the reader to access, such as unpublished operating documents.
Especially in empirical work, the appendix can be used to identify the data sets used, the mathematical-statistical methods used or programs in more detail. If surveys are carried out as part of the investigations, the questions and results must be documented in the appendix. Discussions may only be referred to in the explanations if a result protocol signed by the discussion partner is attached to the work.
If the appendix consists of several elements, the individual elements must be separated from one another by numbering.

Note: If the attachment remains empty, this section can be deleted
