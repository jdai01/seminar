\paragraph{Case Study:} \gls{SESAR} Project \cite{ec_sesar_project} \cite{skybrary_sesar}

The \gls{SESAR} project is the \gls{EU}'s initiative aiming to modernise Europe's air and ground ATM infrastructure and operational procedures.
It is a joint effort driven by the \gls{EU}, EUROCONTROL, and a wide range of public and private, civil and military avaiation stakeholders to achieve the Digital European Sky.

The Digital European Sky leverages the latest technologies to transform Europe's aviation infrastructure, enabling it to handle the future growth and diversity of air traffic safely and effeciently, while minimising environmental impact.
It can increase the level of automation, cyber-secure data sharring and connectivity in \gls{ATM}, and virtualisation of its infrastructure and air traffic service provision in all types of airspaces (including very low and high-altitude operations).

It was identified in 2005 as a project of interest and its implementation is carried out in three phases:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Definition phase (2005-2008): development of air traffic modernisation plan, establishing the different technological stages, priorities and timetables
    \item Development phase (2008-2013): development of basic technologies which will underpin the new generations of systems
    \item Deployment phases (2014-2020, and beyond): large-scale installation of the new systems and the widespread implementation of the related functions
\end{enumerate}
