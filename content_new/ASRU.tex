\subsection{Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding (ASRU)}

Voice communication between ATCOs and pilots using radio equipment is still the main communication channel used in air traffic control, with ATCOs issue verbal commands to the cockpit crew. 
Whenever the information from the voice communication has to be digitalised, ATCOs are burdened to manually enter the information, although it was already uttered. 
On one hand, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) transform the analog voice signal into spoken sqeuence of words.
On the other hand, Automatic Speech Understanding extracts the meaning from the sequence of words, .

When the formal problems of representing lexical syntatic, and semantic information are solved, the spoken call signs still need to be extracted from a verbal transmission. 
+ noisy environment with diffrent spoken accents

Another application of ASRU is the pre-filling of radar labels with information extracted from ATCOs voice transmissions.
