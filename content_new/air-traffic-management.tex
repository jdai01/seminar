\section{Air Traffic Management}

\subsection{Introduction}

\Gls{ATM} is the aggregation of the airborne and ground-based functions required to ensure the safe and efficient movement of aircraft during all phases of operations, through controlled airspaces and on the ground at airports \cite{skybraryATM}.
It comprises serveral components, including \gls{ATS}, \gls{ASM}, and \gls{ATFM} \cite{skybraryATM}.
Figure \ref{fig:atm-structure} shows the structure of \gls{ATM} and relations between \gls{ATS}, \gls{ASM}, and \gls{ATFM}.

\Glspl{ATCO}, part of \gls{ATC} service, are responsible for directing aircraft safely and efficiently, managing takeoffs and landings, maintaining safe distances between aircraft en route and handling emergencies. 
Their role demands high levels of situational awareness, rapid decision-making, and the ability to manage multiple tasks under high stress conditions.
These indispensable skills, such as judgement, flexibility and the ability to handle unexpected situations, remains critical and are not easily replicated by automated systems \cite{eurocontrol2024digitalisation}.



\subsection{Challenges with Integrating UAS to current ATM}

The rapid expansion of commercial aviation, \gls{UAM}, and \glspl{UAV} have significantly increased the complexity of \gls{ASM} \cite{Ramachandran_2025}.
With air traffic volume increases, the scalability of the system is limited by the finite capacity of \glspl{ATCO}, who are subject to workload constraints and cognitive overload \cite{Meier_2024}.
Fatigue and informaion overload  have become key contributors to operational inefficiencies and potential safety risks \cite{Ramachandran_2025}. 
Furthermore, human limitations in reaction time and decision-making speed highlight the need for intelligent, automated support systems that can enhance overall system performance.


Integrating \gls{UAM} into air traffic flow poses a significant challenge due to their unique performance characteristics, which differ from those of fixed-wing aircraft.
These differences can lead to suboptimal use of airport capacity \cite{Schuchardt_2023}.
Compounding the issue is the current shortage of \glspl{ATCO}, alongside the long training periods required to qualify new personnel, this has amplified the demand for \gls{AI}-based solutions in \gls{ATM}. 
\gls{AI} technologies are able to solve these challenges through real-time data processing, predictive analytics, and autonomous decision-making capabilities \cite{Ramachandran_2025}. 
While some automations already exist in some areas \cite{skybrary2025automation}, existing systems often rely on rigid rule-based frameworks and lack the flexibility and adaptability needed for dynamic environments \cite{Meier_2024}. 

The integration of \gls{UAV} into \gls{ATM} has led to the development of a new branch known as \gls{UTM}.
As \glspl{UAV} often operate across both controlled and uncontrolled airspaces -- and \glspl{ATCO} are only responsible for controlled airspaces -- a key challenge arises: there is no \gls{ATC} service in uncontrolled airspaces.
This lack of oversight increases the risk of mid-air collisions or accidents involving other \glspl{UAV}, manned aircraft, ground vehicles, or natural and artificial obstacles.
Therefore, a dedicated system like \gls{UTM} is essential to ensure safe and efficient \gls{UAV} operations in all types of airspace \cite{Zsolt_2017}.

The integration of \gls{UAM} and \gls{UTM} into the existing \gls{ATM} framework will not only stress current infrastructure but also require faster, more adaptive decision-making \cite{Rumba_2020} -- an area where \gls{AI} technologies can provide substantial value.
