\section{Future of AI in ATM}

In a literature review done by Schuchardt \cite{Schuchardt_2023}, it is states that the problem of \gls{ATM} was identified as a potential bottleneck for implementation of \gls{UAM} but no further research could be conducted at that time. 
Since then, the research on using \gls{AI} tools to solve the problems of \gls{ATM} have increased.


% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item Safe flight path through hazardous sky
%     \item Maintain optimal airfraft separation in airspace
%     \item LLM communication
%     \item AI-powered security systems
%     \item Autonomous piloting and UTM -- with unified airspace?
% \end{enumerate}
