\subsection{Dynamic Airspace Sectorisation}

Airspace areas are generally determined by static constraints (e.g. national borders), but are adapted to the changing, dynamic air traffic flow over the day. 
The necessary coordination effort between adjacent areas, heterogenous operational concepts, and different capacity management strategies of decision-making units result in negative operational and economic effects (inefficiencies). 
The current static allocation of airspace sectors leads to operational inefficiencies, since the task load of the air rtaffic controllers significantly deviates according to the changing traffic demand/flow over the day. 
The goal is to ensure a more efficient allocation and harmonized task load distribution for the controllers.
