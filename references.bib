  ABSTRACT = {Urban air mobility is a rapidly growing field of research. While drones or unmanned aerial vehicles have been operated mainly in the private and military sector in the past, an increasing range of opportunities is opening up for commercial applications. A new multitude of passenger-carrying drone or air taxi concepts promises to fulfill the dream of flying above congested urban areas. While early research has been focusing on vehicle development, solutions for urban air traffic management are lagging behind. This paper collects and reviews the main findings of past urban-air-mobility-related research projects at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) to serve as a basis for ongoing research from an air traffic management perspective.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an air traffic management framework to enable multiple fleets of unmanned aerial vehicles to traverse dense, omni-directional air traffic safely and efficiently. The main challenge addressed here is separation assurance in the absence of full coordination and communication. In this framework, each fleet is independently managed by a routing agent, which progressively plans the non-overlapping move-ahead corridors for vehicles in the fleet by solving a nonlinear optimization model. The model is artfully designed so that agents of different fleets need not engage in complicated multilateral communications or make guesses about external vehicles’ flight intents to maintain effective inter-vehicle separation. For a complex routing problem, the framework is able to support centralized fleet routing, decentralized vehicle self-routing, and any other agent-vehicle configuration in between, allowing for customized trade-off between response time and traffic efficiency. Innovative algorithmic enhancements for solving the agent’s nonconvex routing problem are prescribed with detailed annotation. The effectiveness and noteworthy properties of the framework are demonstrated by several simulation experiments.}
